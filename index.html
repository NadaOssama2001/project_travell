                    <p>Egyptian temples were built to worship the gods and to celebrate the pharaohs in ancient Egypt
                        and in areas under Egyptian authority. The temples were seen as the house of the gods or kings
                        to whom they were dedicated. Within these temples, Egyptians performed various religious
                        rituals, which are the basic functions of the Egyptian religion, such as: offering offerings to
                        the gods, reenacting their superstitious interactions during their celebrations, and banishing
                        chaotic forces. These rituals were necessary to continue to preserve Maat, the divine order of
                        the universe. The construction of temples and the care of the gods were the tasks of the
                        pharaohs.
